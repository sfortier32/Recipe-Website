*From July 2023 Project Specifications:*

### Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a single page web application Links to an external site. with a Node.js backend, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to interact with it, perform CRUD operations, store data using local storage, and store data in the back-end. The back-end should be implemented in Node.js and communicate with the front-end using fetch. The project must utilize a database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL) and include routes for all CRUD operations. You are not allowed to use PouchDB for the database.

### Requirements
1. Front-End Development:
   - Design and implement a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to enhance the application's appearance and responsiveness. But, not required. You are allowed to use your own homegrown CSS
   - If you use Bootstrap (etc.), you must still supply your own CSS
   - Implement dynamic updates to the user interface using JavaScript, ensuring a seamless user experience.

2. User Interaction and CRUD Operations:
   - Allow users to create, read, update, and delete data through the user interface.
   - Implement interactive forms and input fields for user data entry and editing.
   - Provide appropriate user feedback and validation for form submissions.
   - Update the UI dynamically when data is created, updated, or deleted.

3. Local Storage:
   - Utilize the browser's local storage feature to store user data persistently.
   - Implement logic to save and retrieve data from local storage as needed.
   - Handle situations where local storage may be unavailable or limited.

4. Back-End Development:
   - Implement a server-side application using Node.js to handle data storage and retrieval.
   - Create routes to handle all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Utilize the Express.js framework to simplify routing and request handling.

5. Database Integration:
   - Choose either MongoDB or PostgreSQL as your preferred database system.
   - Design and create a suitable database schema to store the application data.
   - Implement database connectivity and integration with the Node.js backend.
   - Utilize appropriate database queries and operations to perform CRUD actions.

6. Communication between Front-End and Back-End:
   - Use the fetch API in JavaScript to communicate between the front-end and back-end.
   - Send asynchronous requests from the front-end to the back-end to perform CRUD operations.
   - Handle responses and update the UI accordingly.

7. Error Handling and Validation:
   - Implement robust error handling on both the front-end and back-end.
   - Validate user input and handle validation errors gracefully.
   - Display appropriate error messages to the user.
